								<h2 class="major">About me</h2>
								<span class="right_image main"><img src="images/IMG_3378.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								<p> My name is Felicia Segui and I am currently working as a backend developer consultant. 
									This includes developing new features, testing, database management and docker container orchestration, among other things.
									Before starting at my current position, I studied Engineering Physics at Lund University, from which I have a Master's in Science with a specialization within AI and Machine Learning. 
									Since the beginning of my university studies, my interest in data analytics, especially ML and AI, has continuously been growing.
									I believe that the combination of an academical base in mathematics, strong technical skills and experience from projects "in the real world" makes a great data analyst. 
									The academical base, I have from my studies at Lund University, while the my software development knowledge mainly comes from working during my study time as well as in my current job. 
									While studying I also had a lot of side projects, and you can read about a selection of them under the <a href="#projects">projects tab</a>. 
									Currently besides working, I am studying for the Oracle Java 11 Professional Developer certification, which is a good compliment to the 'hands-on' learning I am gaining from work.
									Looking forward, I see myself working with data analytics, combining the knowledge I gained during my time at university in math, physics and machine learning, with the experience from being a backend engineering consultant as I currently am.

								<span class="left_image main"><img src="images/IMG_0632crop.jpg" alt="" /></span> 
								<p> When I am not nourishing my techy side I like to spend my time running, practicing yoga or hanging out with friends.
									My active lifestyle stems from growing up at a horse farm outside Norrköping, Sweden, and I have spent countless hours in the stable and at showjumping competitions until I started University.
									Even though I do not see horses daily anymore, I always take the chance to go for a ride when I am visiting my parents and the last summer I competed in showjumping a couple of times.

									<h3>Real-time unsupervised log event anomaly detection in public transportation </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/climind.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>
										In my master's thesis, I developed a novel method for detecting anomalies in public transportation bus event log data in real-time, 
										without the need for a labeled dataset. By using a combination of an autoencoder, PCA model, and clustering algorithm, 
										this research successfully identifies anomalies within event sequences. 
										The best-performing model, combining the autoencoder and clustering algorithm, 
										achieved a remarkable F1-score of 0.79. 
										This work contributes to the field of real-time anomaly detection, using combined Machine Learning Models, to enhance public transportation system reliability and security.
									</p>
									
									<h3>cliMind </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/climind.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In the beginning of the autumn 2021 me and two friends started a Machine Learning project for predicting stock market fluctuations, based on weather forecasts.
										This idea came to us from reading articles about the possible correlation between sunny weather and a rising stock market. 
										We thought, why not test the hypothesis? We explored many different ML models and decided to dig deeper into two of them; an Azure AutoML Timeseries model and a Tensorflow Neural Network model.

									<h3>Computer Graphics project: Game </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/dragon.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p>As a final project in a computer graphics course me and another student made an OpenGL game together. 
										Here I got the chance to use my math skills and at the same time expand my software knowledge. 
										In addition to consolidate my C++ writing, I learned how to write pixel shaders, how to navigate between different coordinate systems and the many aspects of creating a well working game.

									<h3> Database modeling project </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/cookies.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>  Together with two other students I created an SQL database for a fictional large scale bakery to keep track of its production and deliveries. 
										The project contained three major parts: a planning part in which we created an ER-model, an SQL part and a part for implementing a REST server.

									<h3> LSTM Networks: NER-Recognition</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/letters.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>  By using recurrent neural networks two models were created and trained to recognize named entities in texts. 
										The first model was a simple recurrent neural network and the second model an LSTM network. 
										From each model two new improved models were created by adding dropout and bidirectional layers.

									<h3> Convolutional Networks: Image-Recognition</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/flowers.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> In this project I used Convolutional Neural networks for determine what kind of flower an image showed. 
										Four different models were built and compared with each other with plots of the train and validation accuracy over epochs, confusion matrices and accuracy scores.
										Both augmented and unmodified images were used, as well as a pretrained convolutional neural base.

									<h3> Decision trees: Implementation of the ID3 classifier </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/trviz.png" alt="" /></span>
									<p> In the course Applied Machine Learning we implemented an ID3 algorithm to generate decision trees, by using recursive methods. 
										The algorithm was then trained and used for classifying handwritten digits. Before implementing the ID3 algorithm we used the already existing
										Scitkit-learn DecisionTreeClassifier for classifying the same dataset and in the end of the assignment the different f1-scores were compared.

									<h3> Scitkit-learn: Extracting Syntactic Groups using machine-learning techniques</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/books.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>In this project we created a program that extracted syntactic groups from a text. 
										We compared a simple non-ML model with a supervised ML-model and further improved the ML-model by adding two dynamic paramaters to the feature vector. 
										From the resulting dataset we extracted a smaller set and implemented a method to find the entities on Wikipedia.

									<h3>Python: Analyzing 911 Calls and Finance </h3>
    								<span class="image main"><img src="images/call.jpg" alt="" /></span>
    								<p>Before starting with the Machine Learning part, the course "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" 
										provided two final projects, which involved data analysis with Pandas and NumPy, as well as visualization tasks 
										where we were encuraged to use Plotly, Seaborn and Cufflinks. Especially in the finance project, I realized the importance
										of having visualization tool skills, as many interesting patterns first became visible after the data underwent different data extractions
										and then shown with carefully chosen graph-types.

    								<span class="image main"><img src="images/chip2.jpg" alt="" /></span>
    								<p>In the course Finite Elementh Method me and a friend investigated how a microchip in Netflix's circuits, was affected by the decreased streaming quality which was implemented when the streaming consumption increased during the COVID-19 pandemy. The analytical part was performed in Matlab and the chip was modeled with the finite element method. The resulting plots showed the temperature distribution with and without decreased streaming quality, as well as the displacement fields due to thermal expansion. </p>

									<h3> Ongoing: IT Consultant at Netcompany A/S</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/letterletter.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> In September 2022 I started working as IT Consultant at Netcompany in Copenhagen. 
										Already the first day, I got on a project at the Danish taxation authorities and I have learnt a lot since then.
										The team I am working in are in charge of the Letter Platform; a component that distributes tax related letters to either physical print or digital mailboxes, depending on a number of receiver specific conditions.
										Effectively, I am working as a backend developer with tasks such as designing and developing new features, testing, database management and docker container orchestration.

										
										<br>
										<br>
										I am working in an international team, with members both from Netcompany and from the customer, which facilitates an environment where many perspectives are heard and different thinking encouraged.
										This, in combination with working agile creates, in my opionion, a good basis for a stable yet efficient and innovative software development and it is a way of working that I thrive with.

									<h3> Part-time Systems Developer at Gaia System AB</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/busbus.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> In September 2021 I started working part-time at Gaia Systems AB, in parallell to my studies. 
										It is the same company as I did an internship at in spring 2021 and I continued on the Machine Learning project that I worked on at the internship, together with other ML and AI oriented projects.
										I worked here until January 2022 when I replaced my studying and part-time working with Master's thesis writing. 
										
										<br>
										<br>

										My main tasks during my time at Gaia were building, training and evaluating ML models in Azure Machine Learning Studio, extracting and transforming big datasets using PySpark in Azure Synapse, as well as link and automate the different parts.

									<h3> R&D Summer Internship at Ericsson</h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/space.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p> The summer 2021 I got the opportunity to work at the research department with high precision satellite positioning, using cellular network assistance data.
										Here I worked on the client side and it was very stimulating to combine programming with my physics and math knowledge at a whole new level.

										<br>
										<br>

										The code was written in C in Ubuntu which I before beginning thought would be a challenge, but after approximately a week I felt confident with the code syntax. 
										Except for thorougly learning C as well as how to work with precision satellite positioning, I developed the ability to quickly get a good overview of large code files.
										This I had to develop because I needed to search for code with a certain functionality in large repositories. 
										Sometimes this was really challenging due to differences in documentation and definitions between the repositories, but in the end super rewarding and a skill I will have use for in the future.

									<h3> ML Internship at Gaia Systems </h3>
									<span class="image main"><img src="images/traffic.jpg" alt="" /></span>
									<p>  In spring 2021 I went on an internship at Gaia Systems, a company that is specialized in Data analytics, IoT and AI. 
										Gaia Public Transport is a passenger information system and currently the main project at Gaia. 
										The system is a cloud-based real-time system that facilitates travels for passengers, drivers and operators and also the project that I have mainly been a part of this internship. 
										<br>
										<br>
										My work tasks during this internship were machine learning and AI oriented. 
										I mainly worked with the previously mentioned project Gaia Public Transport, but also with a smaller computer vision project that aims to classify plant weed, plant diseases and plant vermin. 
										The prior goal for me in this internship was to develop an Azure ML-model that predicts bus stop arrival times for Gaia Public Transport. 
										Since the project I worked on was in a research state, everything except the goal was very open and the type of model, features, limits and parameters were specified as time went. 
										Because of this my tasks were very varied, within the ML area. 
										I had tasks such as pre-research, data extraction and transformation, model building and evaluation of the model, among others.
										<br>
										<br>
										In the pure technical area the most valuable experience for me was working cloud based in Azure, with the services that were included. 
										Azure ML Studio and Azure Synapse were the platforms that I mainly worked on, which was super interesting as I for the first time got the possibility to apply my knowledge from University at real life cases.
										Apart from purely technical aspects I have learnt a lot about how it is to work with software development in bigger groups, as well as alone remotely during the Covid-19 pandemy. 
										As the proceeding of my project was in some ways dependent on other colleagues, I got both insights in software areas other than machine learning, since it has been crucial that I understand what is going on when my colleagues works with their parts, as well as a better understanding for the whole process on a bigger level.
